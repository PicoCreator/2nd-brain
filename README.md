This is my public "second brain" store of notes, and various other things.
These notes are "raw" and not a replacement for more "polished" content that would be found in blogs / etc.

## User Guide

-   The folders are named in [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) format - optimizing for:
    -   P - nearterm projects i want to do
    -   A - standards i want to upkeep
    -   R - resources for stuff i like
    -   Archive - for misc past junk i dont see myself needing anymore

# Why is this public?
This was mostly inspired by swyx second brain, which you can find here : https://github.com/sw-yx/brain

However in more practical terms, i been employing note keeping for ages across a large number of notebooks, google keep, evernote, markdown repo, etc, etc.

Exhibit A: 2 drawers of some of my old discarded notebooks - so yes I have a problem

This is more of an attempt to conslidate them all, and end this back and forth across multiple tools - hopefully once and for all - and doing in public will hopefully prevent me from switching things around (again)

Additionally: Personal / Sensitive / Private stuff is already being stored in a seperate repo.
