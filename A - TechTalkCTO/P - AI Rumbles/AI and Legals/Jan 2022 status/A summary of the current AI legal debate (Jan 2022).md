In the recent months, the AI scene has been blowing up, especially within the art space. With both the public and legal world being in debate on how AI, and their generated content should be treated legally.

And because most lawyers are not computer scientist, nor vice visa. Despite both speaking in their own languages. The debate has been undecided (and may do so for years).

So lets put ethics aside. And focus on the legals - and because this is legals, huge warning on this being a super long article.

Also disclaimer: I am not your lawyer, this is not legal advice

# Our Current Status: Uncertain

One key case study of the debate (which is not finalized) is how the "US Copyright Office" has been going back and forth on the copyright status of an AI generated comic ([link here](https://www.cbr.com/ai-comic-deemed-ineligible-copyright-protection/))

This is potentially, one of many cases which will rise up now and in the future. Where three major questions are arised.

- Is it permissible, under fairuse, to use copyrighted materials to train an AI?
	- More specifically, regarding copyrighted materials made avaliable in public on the internet.
- Can generated works, be copyrighted? 
	- With the copyright assigned to the "human operator of the AI" and/or the "AI model".
- If so, can an AI model be co-assigned copyright of an generated work (ie. artworks)? 
	- Taking it one step further, if the human co-author of the work relinquish their copyright, can an AI model be the sole owner of the generated work?

Within these 3 questions lies two major side. And their agenda
- Pro AI group: 
	- Wants AI to be absolved of copyright issue, when training on copyright data
	- Wants AI generated content, to be copyrightable, and hence be commercially viable, or recognized and accepted in society.
- Anti AI group:
	- Human copyright, should be protected. AI training on copyright materials, is a violation of the copyright owners rights.
	- Only humans are able to create copyright works

And within the storm, lies the following common trends in the argument...

## Proposition 1: AI learns and recreates artworks like a living being

According to this view, AI should be treated like a living being because it learns and recreates artworks. And that AI has the ability to create new and original works that are the product of its own creativity, just like a human artist. 

Where, AI should be eligible for copyright protection because it is the author of the work.

Additionally, proponents of this argument, also asserts that the process of training an AI on copyrighted materials, is not a violation of copyright, and works under the same terms fairuse. As this is similar to an artist going into a photo gallery. And recreating the artwork seperately, from memory. 

Another common argument here, is also how real artists, are doing the same, constantly "stealing ideas" and remixing.

It is worth noting, depending on the country or state (or specifics). Recreating of artworks, even in parts, “extensively, obviously and knowingly”, is classified as a violation of copyright. In a way, intentions matter.

The cavet here is that, one most of the AI generated output, are not one-to-one copies. However for elements that may seem to be copied over, nobody can testify on what the AI is "thinking, or knowing, or intending". 

So unless proven otherwise, there is an argument to be made that it is not a knowing violation.

> Seperately, directly copying with transformation (picture to painting) without credit and permission of the source material, while not a copyright violation legally in most places, is widely considered as poor practise, or "unethical". With many high profile cases of artist and photographers being "banned" from the industry for doing so.

## Proposition 2: AI is just a tool

According to this view, no assertion is made that AI should be able to own copyright.

However it is asserted, that the AI is a tool, like a paintbrush, or more appropriately a collection of stencils. While the human operator, is the "artist" who decides on the usage of the tool through the instructions given.

While there is assertion, that as a tool, its free of copyright violation. 

Alternatively, since the AI samples a large body of materials, any inspiration or usage of the source material is under "fairuse" or is the equivalent of "inspiration".

This gets extremly complicated, as with the case of stencils. Depending on how it is made and use it can be both a complete violation, or free of violation. However it is not without grounds.

(More regarding the fairuse limitation in the opposition side)

> Another notable common proposition, is that such a tool should be allowed to "get away with it" for the "sake of progress", and in overall good for society. This was intentionally left out, as it's an ethical argument - and not a legal one.

## Opposition 1: Only "real" humans is eligible for copyright.

While the exact definition will differ nation to nation, most definition of copyright, require the work to have some form of either originality, or creativity (however small it maybe).

One version of this view, is how the AI is akin to using dices, and math, to generate artworks in a nearly detirministic way. The AI is not capable of originality or creativity.

This is further evidenced by the fact that, when you lock all the random variables, and the input. The AI will create the exact same output consistently. Like a math formular.

The assertion here is, since you cannot assign copyright to a math formular, you cannot assign copyright to an AI.

> On a technical level, you can replicate this consistantly by running most AI models slowly in detirministic "CPU mode", with a fixed seed (the random dice number). While intentionally avoiding "GPU mode", which [for technical reasons, have random inaccuracies by design](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8167778)

There is also an assertion here, from a smaller group. That since AI is not eligible to be a copyright holder, and create copyrighted works. All its content is copyright free. Or effectively un-copyrightable. This includes future works made on, and modified from the AI generated artwork.

This, can be viewed as direct opposition of Proposition 1.

## Opposition 2: Fair use is not automatic and is case by case

This is less of a "point of view" and is simply building on existing legal frameworks.

Fair use, is alot more complicated then most people realize. And can change drastically from country to country. Or even on a case by case basis. Let alone a case containing a million copyright artworks.

If anything the scale of this dataset, is what in part complicates and blind-sided the legal community. As fair-use has always been evaluated on a case-by-case basis. 1 at a time. And all of sudden we now have a tool, with potentially a million violations in training, and a million cases in artworks generated.

So when I refer to fair use here, I will not be speaking for any one country or state. But will be talking in a more general sense where fair use is recognized.

And in that sense, there are huge cavets in the fairuse defense. Even in the usage of the strongest form.

- Fair-use is generally allowed for research and learning purposes, in private and personal settings. This is also why disney will never be sueing you for your sketches in your primary school textbook.
- Fair-use slowly falls apart, when the generated material is published or distributed for personal, reputational or commercial gain.
- Fair-use really fall apart, when the generated material in question, competes directly with the original rights holder ability to profit from their work in substential ways.

> For the sake of avoiding confusion with non-legal folks, this article is specifically about the copyright around the generated content. Copyright around individual characters, landmarks, their designs, likeness, names, etc - is always retained by their right holders.
> 
> In simpler terms, even if you yourself (or an AI) draw a "very unique" version of Mickey Mouse. Disney still owns the copyright to Mickey Mouse character, and you don't. In a way, your unique artwork is now jointly owned by you and disney.
> 
> While disney would need your permission (by right), if they were to print & distribute copies of your unique artwork. Likewise you would need permission from disney to do the same.
> 
> Fair use will still however protect you in the context of keeping your sketches for private and personal use.

If the goverments of the world, and lawyers decide this would be the decision on AI. It would simply means things would be very very complicated. On a case by case basis. 

Amusingly, We may not have enough lawyers on earth to deal with this from an adminstrative point of view.

While all of this is very hypothethical, the fair-use defense may depend very heavily on the prompt, and training data. And the individual involved (and how they make money)

**The case of Greg Rutkowski**

For example, take a notable example: Greg Rutkowski. Most notable for his very unique style especially in fantasy drawings. Who has made a career and a name for himself for creating artworks, most notable concept artworks for game companies, in his particular style. Which in that context, they will have permission to replicate (since they contracted him).

However since the rise of AI artworks, his name, has been made fabous, and used extensively as a "shortcut" to creating beautiful artworks through the AI using the words "in the style of Greg Rutkowski".

It is then plausable, that an argument could be made that there is substential commercial loss for him since the release of the AI model, due to loss contract opportunities. With game companies, who can now replicate his style for their use case using the AI models instead. Especially when they create the artworks with the phrase "Greg Rutkowski".

In that sense, there is an argument to be made, that artworks generated with his name, is admission of intent in replicating an individual artist, and depriving them the opportunity to commercialise on their own unique style or brand name. In an specific industry they are active in. (artworks for game companies)

A similar argument can also be made for any custom built AI models, trained specifically to fully replicate an individual person.

Inversely, if the prompt, and the dataset used spans a large enough body of work, of a common shared style, lets say "in the style of the 80s". The argument may not hold up.

**The case of Culture Icons**

Another example, would be take a notable culture icon. Lets say Morgan Freeman, who is an actor. Who has made a career of himself for his unique looks, and talking style.

If an artist (or an AI artist) were to do painting of him, in a very stylistic, pop-art manner. Even commercially. On a small scale (think cheap small souveniour shop). It may end up being on the borderline of fair-use, and may even rule in the artist favour.

In general, the main argument would be, an artist selling paintings at $50 a piece, on a small scale. Has a negligable impact on Morgan Freeman, ability to market and sell himself as an actor (or voice actor).

A notable point, would also be how the artist currently do not actively commercialize and sell his likeness in an official merchandising or art store. Further reinforcing the argument, that such sales do not compete or hurt the artist commercially.

**Now imagine all that nuence detrimination in every dataset, and generated artworks**

It would be an adminstrative legal nightmare, that the AI proponents want to avoid.

## Opposition 3: The source material have not given their consent

This is arguably the most notable opposition point. And it comes in 2 layers
- The consent to download and save a copy of the data.
- The consent to use said downloaded data, for the use of AI training.

While copyright and consent, have various different levels. In the case of the internet, it is not uncommon for an artist or a content creator, to give limited permission to view their work online, in the context of a browser. But no download rights. 

Unless the copyright holder either releases those rights (ex: Creative Commons, Copyleft, etc) or specifically grants certain rights to you, then distributing their work without their permission (even for personal use) is a violation of their copyright.

When in doubt about this, feel free to ask lawyers of netflix or any other streaming service on downloading rights.

Fair use, apply typically, in very limited use cases of educational, or non-commercial purposes.

The issue here, is the assets were downloaded by the AI makers, for the purpose of buildingAI model, with commercial interest and use case (esp for stability.ai, and openAI, less so for Bloom)

So for the first step, this is not even about AI, and copyright. Its simply about the internet and copyright.

For some AI models, especially for AI art generation models. This may come to haunt them in the future. Or maybe it will not. Organizing a class action lawsuit on a planet scale, is a "complex challenge" in itself after all. 

For others, like OpenAI co-pilot, it avoids this issue by training on github open source code libraries, which provides the required download permissions.

The second step, depends heavily on the rulings involving around Proposition 1 (is AI recognized as a learning entity, and is simply not replicating the work). And "fairuse", where it is acceptable to train an AI for the intention of letting it "learn".

Because substitute AI with a human child, and issues involved in the second step, is resolved.

So where does that lead us?

Well no where frankly. Many courts are flip floping around, or playing the waiting game to take time and figure this out.

And it is a ticking time bomb. 

There is a danger in that process, as AI starts being more and more prelevant and used within our day to day workflow. With new companies being entirely dependent on it.

A drastic decision either way, will have ripple effects across many individuals. (Including mine)

So in a real sense, it would be better if we figure out an answer earlier then later.

So up next, in part 2, I propose classifying AI models, and AI generated content as derivative works. To help potentially resolve this debate. Putting on both a legal hat, and a programming hat.
