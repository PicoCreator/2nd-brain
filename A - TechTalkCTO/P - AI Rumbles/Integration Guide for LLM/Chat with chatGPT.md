> The following is my conversation log with chatGPT, while writting this article.

I am writing a blog post / guide on how to best integrate with LLM.
On a high level, i plan to cover the following

- Finding a use case, using the "intern model"
- Prompt engineering, using a single AI completion call
	- cover the concept
		- link to existing guides / collection of prompts
		- cover briefly on prompt injection
		- cover briefly on how to prevent hallucinations
- Prompt chaining, using multiple AI completion calls
	- viewing LLM completions, as "function / input / output"
- Embedding search
	- how it is used for search
	- how it can be used with prompt chaining to answer questions
- Finetuning
	- disclaimer that is typically "not worth it"
	- however it can be incredibly useful for smaller specific use cases
	- useful for swapping out from larger more expensive models
- Switching AI models altogether !
	- view this as a cost optimization, more then a "capabilities enhancment"
	- when used with, can lead to very impressive results
	- model hosting IS NOT EASY, and hard to deploy at scale / speed

Is there any points you think I should add?

It sounds like you have a solid plan for your guide on integrating with a large language model (LLM). Here are a few additional points you may want to consider including:

Scaling: Depending on the size of your use case, you may need to consider how to scale the use of a LLM. This could include using multiple instances of the model, or using distributed computing.
Latency: LLMs can take a significant amount of time to generate responses, especially for longer prompts or more complex tasks. You may want to include information on how to reduce latency, such as by generating responses in parallel or using a smaller version of the model.
Security: When working with sensitive data, it's important to ensure that the data is properly secured. This could include encrypting data before sending it to the model, or using a private cloud or on-premises deployment.
Monitoring: When using a LLM in a production environment, it's important to monitor its performance and usage. This could include tracking API calls, response times, and error rates.
Training data: It's important to use high-quality training data to fine-tune a LLM. This could include using a combination of publicly available data and proprietary data.
Please let me know if there are any additional questions or areas you would like me to expand on.

Sounds good, can you please help me draft this article in markdown format?
I'd be happy to help you draft your article in markdown format! However, please note that I am a language model, and while I can help you write the content, I will not be able to directly create a markdown file for you. Here's a possible outline for your article:

How to Best Integrate with a Large Language Model (LLM)

Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular for a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, integrating a LLM into your workflow can be challenging. In this guide, we will cover the best practices for integrating with a LLM, including:

Finding a Use Case
The first step in integrating with a LLM is to identify a use case. One way to do this is to use the "intern model" to explore different tasks and see which ones the model performs well on.

Prompt Engineering
Prompt engineering is the process of designing the input to a LLM to get the desired output. To do this effectively, it's important to understand the concept of prompt injection and how to prevent hallucinations. A good resource for prompt engineering is the GPT-3 Playground which allows you to explore different prompts and see how the model responds.

Prompt Chaining
Prompt chaining is the process of using multiple AI completion calls to get a more complex response. This is especially useful for answering questions or generating longer text. To do this effectively, it's important to view LLM completions as "function / input / output" and to chain the prompts together in a logical order.

Embedding Search
Embedding search is a technique that can be used to search through a large dataset of text to find the most relevant results. This can be used with prompt chaining to answer questions or find specific information within a large dataset.

Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning a LLM is the process of training the model on a specific task or dataset. While it's typically not worth it for larger, more general-purpose models, fine-tuning can be useful for smaller, specific use cases. It can also be useful for swapping out from larger, more expensive models.

Switching AI Models Altogether
In some cases, it may be more cost-effective to switch to a different AI model altogether. This can lead to very impressive results, but it's important to keep in mind that model hosting is not easy and can be hard to deploy at scale and speed.

Scaling
Depending on the size of your use case, you may need to consider how to scale the use of a LLM. This could include using multiple instances of the model, or using distributed computing.

Latency
LLMs can take a significant amount of time to generate responses, especially for longer prompts or more complex tasks. To reduce latency, you may want to consider generating responses in parallel or using a smaller version of the model.

Security
When working with sensitive data, it's important to ensure that the data is properly secured. This could include encrypting data before sending it to the model, or using a private cloud or on-premises deployment.

Monitoring
When using a LLM in a production environment, it's important to monitor its performance and usage. This could include tracking API calls, response times, and error rates.
