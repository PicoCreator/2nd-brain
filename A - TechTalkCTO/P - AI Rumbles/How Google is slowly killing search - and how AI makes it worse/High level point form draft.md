- The internet is an ecosystem made of multiple systems interacting with another, in a feedback loop
- The unwritten rule of the internet
	- All website content is created for either
		- Money (typically via ads, or sales of goods and services)
		- fame or influence (Social Capital)
		- educational purposes
	- For all pratical purposes, even the most noble of writers need to make a living, have food and a roof.
	- So with a few notable exceptions (like wikipedia), all sites include some mixture of the first 2 to be sustainable
		- Even then, wikipedia will solicitate donations from their audience from time to time
	- Creating good high quality content is hard
		- Getting paird for writing such content is hard

- Short summary of the search engine wars?
	- How google won the search wars
		- Google was not the first search engine
		- To condense 90s search war history
		- Search sites, while it exists, were
			- Full of ads
			- Full of results stuffed with keywords, which made search "difficult" (the useful stuff was in page 3 onwards)
		- Google came into the scene with simplicity
			- With a "pretty smart" page rank formula that help bring up the result that is actually useful
			- And crushed the search war in the 90's by constantly tweaking the formula to be ahead of the game
			- All while adhering to the unwritten rule
			- Sites get traffic from google, they acheive their goals (money, flame or influence), google gets a cut in the process - a general win win
	- So what changed for google since the 90s?
		- Ad monopoly is an irresistable money printer
			- Slowly and surely, google been increasing the amount of ads on their search result
			- Going as far as having the first whole page being ads, forcing the user scroll down : just like the early yahoo.
		- Google has not kept up with SEO spam
			- While google initial work with pagerank allowed them to stay ahead of the spam in the 90s, and 2000s. They been failing lately
			- It has gotten bad enough, that "searching reddit" is a known "lifehack" as it helps filter out the bulk of the SEO spam (which would be downvoted to death)
			- The rise of automated, or semi-automated SEO spam.
		- This 2 factors combined, slowly changed google into something similar to the state of yahoo, in the early 90's

- (SKIP) Google started breaking the unwritten rule, by extracting the results directly into the response
	- In an effort to keep users on their platform (and retain all  ad profit)
	- This leads to more news and content creators, to publish either behind a paywall or a subscription

- How AI fixes the SEO spam problem
	- By filtering out junk content with all the keyword, but no substance to the question
- How AI makes the problem worse
	- It however, breaks that relationship between search aggregator and content provider
	- Because there is "nothing to gain" for letting AI aggregate and provide such results (as there is no click). ChatGPT+internet actually makes this relationship worse.

- AI generated content is, and will generate more SEO spam
	- Which in turn, when fed back to train the AI, which may end up with more spam.
