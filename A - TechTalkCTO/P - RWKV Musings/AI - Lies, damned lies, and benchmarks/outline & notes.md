- the delima in AI benchmarks - why over optimizing can kill your model
	- 
- this is regarding observations from within the RWKV community

- imo one of the biggest problems for AI benchmarking today
	- is they were created by us AI engineers
	- not by the user
	  
- and is very easy to get lost in the forest for the trees
- the importance of community feedback -vs- benchmarks

- whats good (by community feedback)
	- good multi language support
- whats bad
	- low memory size
