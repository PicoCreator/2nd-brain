- How AI has advanced drastically in the past 1 year
	- The 2 major changes for users in 2022, can be seen in "prompt-to-output" models mostly
		- Text generation (anything from clickbate headlines, to code) 
		- AI art generation
	- The best way to understand these two, is to illustrate both being used together

- Holy shit, does that mean i can use it to generate anything?
	- Yes, and no - its not a silver bullet
	- These new generation of AI is more willing to be creative then factual
	- So for the use case of creative work (like problem solving, article writing, drawing) it works well in combination with a human.

  If you dealt with such a person, you know there is both wisdom, and lots of hidden crap you need to filter out

- How is that possible, isn't it trained on nearly a terabytes of factual data?

Yes, but it is not thinking, it is dreaming.

Understnadbly, the above is confusing, so let me elaborate...

To understand better, lets start with an oversimplified explaination on how these AI models fundementally work. By using a human analogies, which you may have relatable real life experience with.

> First the AI is given a giant dataset, of many articles (or images) scrapped from the internet from various different sources. Which is used to provide the foundation, of all its knowledge, loosely connected together. 
> 
> This is then trained together with possible prompts or questions given by the user, and responses given by the AI. This can be an overlapping or seperate dataset.

Once this is completed we have a working neural network, or a trained model. With all these data that are loosely connected. (How such a model is generated from the dataset, is typically tuned for the model use cases, and another topic altogether)

> The human analogy, would be you right now, with all your past knowledge, or experiences in school or in life. Snapshot and recorded, in your head. Minus your emotions, and your feelings, or anything hormonal related.

Now when you are asking it a question, or giving it a prompt. The key thing to note here, is that its not thinking of an answer or deliberating for an answer from the trained model. For the lack of better words its hallucinating the answer, using that snapshot of knowledge.

> The closest human analogy I could think of, is that you as a human was told a prompt or a phrase, for example "go buy milk tomorrow, when you wake up". Before going to sleep.
> 
> For most folks, sleep is when they as an individual have little to no control with how the story goes (ignoring the lucky few lucid dreamers). 
> 
> In this state, your mind starts to take that last phrase that is stuck in your head, and it starts dreaming a story around that phrase.
> 
> Where you are an individual in a dream, and your brain the dream world doing its best to be as convincing as possible that its real and not a dream world, continously writing the story back and forth with your interactions and actions.
> 
  All while using the snapshot of all your past knowledge and experience, in your brain. To make your dreamworld as realistic as possible

Flipping it back around

> You, with your prompts is a participant indivdual in a dream.
> With the AI being the dream world, trying its best to be, as convincingly as possible, a good dream. Where it answer your questions in a very belivable manner.
> 
> And just like your dream world, it can be at times entirely realistic, and factually accurate, or as imaginary as it wants to be

This dreamlike state, allows it both to make basic math mistakes with high confidence

To hilariously answer questions as a cat when instructed

To very impressively, emulating interactions with a virtual machines (rather accurately!)

- What does it mean for the future of work?
	- Im going to avoiding speculating too much here, because predicting the future accurately is really really hard, and I want to avoid adding to the FOMO
	- in the best case scenerio first it will be exciting, with the rise of new exciting tools, then it will be really boring, with small but very useful enhancements to daily work tools.
	- We will see more and more of AI tools in chat based, or maybe even speach based being integrated in various things in our daily life
	- This will make automation in general more accessible
	- While lowering the barrier of entry in performing such automation
	- This is significant enough, that in my oppion, every startup found (including myself) should be taking notes, and exploring how to integrate 

> Was this written by an AI?
> No, though i really did try my best to make it do so. But somehow it just seemed to prefer the "typical coporate copywriting style", which ultimately ain't me
